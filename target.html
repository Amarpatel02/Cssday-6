          cricketer who currently captains the India national cricket team
          across all formats. He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of
          the best batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening
          batters of all time,[4] Sharma is known for his timing, elegance,
          six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. Sharma holds several
          batting records which famously include most sixes in international
          cricket,[a] most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries
          at Cricket World Cups (7) and joint most hundreds in Twenty20
          Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is the first player to score 5 T20I
          centuries.[6] He plays for Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in

          team has won 5 titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 under his
          leadership, making him the most successful captain in IPL history,
          sharing this record with MS Dhoni (5 title wins in IPL). With India,
          Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and
          the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both
          tournaments. Rohit is one of four players to have played in every
          edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007
          to the latest one in 2022. Sharma currently holds the world record for
          the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International (ODI)
          match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in
          ODIs and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a
          single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer
          of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has received two national honours,
          the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel
          Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government of India. Under his captaincy,
          India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and
          eighth time the country won the title, both in ODI format as well as
          the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I
          format.

          international cricketer who represents the Indian national cricket
          team in all formats. He is an all-rounder, who bats left-handed and
          bowls left-arm orthodox spin. He is regarded as one of the best

          fifth-fastest player to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Test
          cricket in 2021. Jadeja was the leading wicket-taker in the 2013 ICC
          Champions Trophy and received the man of the match award as a member

          Super Kings at the 2012 IPL Players Auction. He was bought by the
          Gujarat Lions in the 2016 IPL Players Auction for ₹9.5 crores after
          the Chennai Super Kings were banned from the IPL for two seasons. On
          22 January 2017, Jadeja became the first Indian left-arm spinner to
          take 150 One Day International wickets, when he dismissed Sam Billings
          at Eden Gardens, Kolkata.[6] In March 2017, he became the top ranked
          bowler in the world leaving behind Ravichandran Ashwin who held that
          position for a long time.[7] He was announced as captain of the
          Chennai Super Kings IPL franchise, for the 2022 IPL season, succeeding
