          Keshav Gangadhar Tilak <br>
          
          Keshav Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in an Marathi Hindu
          Chitpavan Brahmin family in Ratnagiri, the headquarters of the
          Ratnagiri district of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay
          Presidency).[1] His ancestral village was Chikhali. His father,
          Gangadhar Tilak was a school teacher and a Sanskrit scholar who died
          when Tilak was sixteen. In 1871, Tilak was married to Tapibai (Née
          Bal) when he was sixteen, a few months before his father's death.
          After marriage, her name was changed to Satyabhamabai. He obtained his
          Bachelor of Arts in first class in Mathematics from Deccan College of
          Pune in 1877. He left his M.A. course of study midway to join the
          L.L.B course instead, and in 1879 he obtained his L.L.B degree from
          Government Law College.[8] After graduating, Tilak started teaching
          mathematics at a private school in Pune. Later, due to ideological
          differences with the colleagues in the new school, he withdrew and
          became a journalist. Tilak actively participated in public affairs. He
          stated: "Religion and practical life are not different. The real
          spirit is to make the country your family instead of working only for
          your own. The step beyond is to serve humanity and the next step is to
          serve God."[9] Inspired by Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, he co-founded the
          New English school for secondary education in 1880 with a few of his
          college friends, including Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Mahadev Ballal
          Namjoshi and Vishnushastri Chiplunkar. Their goal was to improve the
          quality of education for India's youth. The success of the school led
          them to set up the Deccan Education Society in 1884 to create a new
          system of education that taught young Indians nationalist ideas
          through an emphasis on Indian culture.[10] The Society established the
          Fergusson College in 1885 for post-secondary studies. Tilak taught
          mathematics at Fergusson College. In 1890, Tilak left the Deccan
          Education Society for more openly political work.[11] He began a mass
          movement towards independence by an emphasis on a religious and
          cultural revival.[12]

        <p id="bhagat">
          Bhagat Singh <br />
          

          Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian
          anti-colonial revolutionary,[3] who participated in the mistaken
          murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in what
          was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[5] He
          later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central
          Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on
          the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him
          into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at
          age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing
          ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] the charismatic Singh[8]
          electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted
          urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent
          but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.[9] In
          December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both
          members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist
          Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old
          British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is
          today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for
          the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had
          intended to assassinate.[10] They held Scott responsible for the death
          of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having
          ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks
          thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station
          on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across
          the street by Rajguru, a marksman.[11][12] As he lay injured, he was
          shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report
          showing eight bullet wounds.[13] Another associate of Singh, Chandra
          Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan
          Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.[11][12]

        <p id="bose">
          Subhas Chandra Bose <br />
          

          Subhas Chandra Bose (/ʃʊbˈhɑːs ˈtʃʌndrə ˈboʊs/ ⓘ shuub-HAHSS CHUN-drə
          BOHSS;[12] 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist
          whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among
          many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial
          Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and
          military failure. The honorific 'Netaji' (Bengali: "Respected Leader")
          was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian
          soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials
          in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout
          India.[h] Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali
          family in Orissa during the British Raj. An early recipient of an
          Anglo-centric education, after college he was sent to England to take
          the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in
          the first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing
          nationalism as a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose
          joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian
          National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a
          group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform
          and more open to socialism.[i] Bose became Congress president in 1938.
          After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the
          Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of
          British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had
          grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to
          non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself.[15] After
          the large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned
          in protest,[16] Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted
          from the party.[17][18]

        <p id="mangal">
          Mangal Pandey <br> was an Indian soldier who played a key role in the
          events taking place just before the outbreak of the Indian rebellion
          of 1857. He was a sepoy (infantryman) in the 34th Bengal Native
          Infantry (BNI) regiment of the British East India Company. In 1984,
          the Indian government issued a postage stamp to remember him. His life
          and actions have also been portrayed in several cinematic productions
